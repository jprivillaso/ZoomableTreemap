ZoomableTreemap
===============

Created a Zoomable Treemap with d3.js representing some properties of some countries. 
The area of each node is calculated with 'value' property of the json file and the color 
is calculated depending on the color property placed in the json file too.

I based my code on <a href="http://data.passiondataviz.fr/recettes2013/">this</a>, it's a nice example too.
